            Symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild flu-like symptoms to pneumonia
            (lung infection). Symptoms can develop and change rapidly, so it is
            best to record your symptoms every day. Most people recover easily
            from COVID-19, but others may get very sick, very quickly.

            The Tracker asks you questions about symptoms you are experiencing
            at this moment. It also asks other questions related to COVID-19. At
            the end of the Tracker, you get an overview of your answers. If you
            track your symptoms daily, you can follow changes over time. The
            questions will change as we learn more about COVID-19.
