            Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild flu-like symptoms to
            pneumonia (lung infection). Symptoms can develop and change rapidly,
            so it is best to record your symptoms every day. Most people recover
            easily from COVID-19, but others may get very sick, very quickly.

            This Symptom Tracker asks you questions about health symptoms you

            It also asks other questions related to COVID-19. At the end of the
            Symptom Tracker you get an overview of your current symptoms. If you
            keep on tracking your symptoms daily, you can follow changes over
            time.
